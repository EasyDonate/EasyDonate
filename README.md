EasyDonate
=================

EasyDonate is an open-source platform for gaming communities to
accept payment for services they provide.  It is designed to make
donating fast and simple for your players, and provides an extensive
API for writing custom applictations to interface with your donation
page.

The API
--------------

Requests to the EasyDonate API are done via HTTP GET in the following format
```
http://{application_url}/api/{interface}/{method}?key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&params...
```

The API is a work in progress, if you would like to see methods or interfaces added,
drop me a line or open up an issue.
